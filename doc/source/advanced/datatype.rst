***********************************
Data Types in Lux
***********************************

.. note:: You can follow along this tutorial in a Jupyter notebook. 

Currently, Lux supports four data types:

* Quantitative
* Temporal
* Nominal
* ID

Note that these data types are different from Pandas `dtype`. These data types are automatically inferred based on the `dataframe` inputted.
The following code snippet shows what data types were inferred:

.. code-block:: python
    df = pd.read_csv()
